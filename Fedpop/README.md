## Implementation

There are two folders: [pathological](./pathological) and [practical](./practical). 
- The [pathological](./pathological) folder contains all source code for experiment in the pathological setting;
- The [practical](./practical) folder contains all source code for experiment in the practical setting.

See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.
